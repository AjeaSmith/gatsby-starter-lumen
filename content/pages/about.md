Hey, I'm Ajea. I'm a Software developer. I've been just enjoying the journey and trying to make myself a better developer. 80% of the time I'm busy making beautiful things with the web and keeping my skills sharp with my favorite YouTubers like **Brad Traversy Media, New Boston, Kevin Powell, Net Ninja, CodeWithChris,** and more. The other 20% is spent creating posts related to frontend development, and getting some exercise by going outside walking, bike riding, and anything else I can think of :)

**Fun fact, my favorite music to code to is Trip Hop / Lofi mix, Matt Corby, Amy Whinehouse, and Twenty One Pilots.**
